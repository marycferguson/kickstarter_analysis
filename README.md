**Overview of kickstarter_analysis\
	This analysis was completed to better understand formulas, formatting,  pivot tables, and chart creation in Excel. These skills were used to analyze the kickstarter data to better understand the relationship between campaign goals, campaign launch dates and the success/failure of the campaigns.

**Results**
 Outcomes by Launch Date
  Kickstarter Campgains launched in May were the most succesful in the data provided. Kickstarter Campagins launched towards year's end were the least succesful. 
  Outcomes Based on Gaols
   The smallest campaign goal (<100) and campgain goals from $45,000 to $49,999 had the largest difference between succesful and failed campaigns. 
   Limitations
    This data set was only based on one organization's fundraising data and may not be a representation of all Kickstarter campaigns.
